We worked on mental health analysis with a sqlite file provided by our facilitator from kaggle by ifeoluwa oduwaiye

from our team analysis, the insights we were able to come up with is the prevalence of mental health in the tech industry, the reoccurence of mental illness based on past family history, and creating of awareness of mental health challenges in work places.

we ran a sql query based on our insight 

we also did research on mental health and types and how it affects our daily lives an came to a conclusion that will help curb and manage mental health documented on our pdf file.
